dApp Launchpad is an automated CLI tool for initializing, creating, and deploying a fully-integrated web3 dApp project.

dApp projects are divided into two parts:

- [Frontend](frontend.md): The frontend runs on Next.js. 
- [Smart contracts](smart-contracts.md): The smart contracts use a Hardhat environment.

The tool automates basic activity such as auto-updating contract artifacts, (re)deploying contracts on code changes, and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for frontend code changes, and more.
