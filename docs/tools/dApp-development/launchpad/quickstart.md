## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18.x.x is recommended.
- Anything above Node version 16.14.x is supported.
- We recommend [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm]] for managing Node installations.

## Install the app

Open a terminal window and run the following command to install the launchpad:

```sh
npm install -g @polygonlabs/dapp-launchpad
```

## Initialize a new project

```sh
dapp-launchpad init <PROJECT-NAME>
```

This creates a new directory in your current directory, initializes a minimal dApp project, and installs the required packages.
