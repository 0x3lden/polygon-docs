FxPortal Bridge is similar to POS Bridge with a feature of using ERC standardized tokens without mapping.

For more info about FxPortal, please read [the FxPortal overview documentation](../../pos/how-to/bridging/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal.md).

FxPortal bridge functionality is available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/0xPolygon/maticjs-fxportal) as a plugin for maticjs. The package provides different API's for interacting with bridge.
