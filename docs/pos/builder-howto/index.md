Welcome to the Polygon PoS builder how-tos section! 

## Common tasks

There are a number of guides here to help you get started with technical tasks like bridging assets from Ethereum to the Polygon PoS chain and vice-versa, smart contract development basics covering deployment and verification, messaging between Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) networks, etc. Check out the links listed below:

* [Bridge tokens from Ethereum to PoS](bridging/ethereum-polygon/ethereum-to-matic.md)
* [Bridge tokens from PoS to Ethereum](bridging/ethereum-polygon/matic-to-ethereum.md)
* [L1 - L2 communication](bridging/l1-l2-communication/state-transfer.md)
* [Work with smart contracts on PoS](smart-contracts/index.md)

## Polygon DID

Included in the section is an elaborate startup guide for users who wish to implement the Polygon DID, which is a three-part package consisting of an identity-registrar, identity-resolver, and identity-registry-contract.
