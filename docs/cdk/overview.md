The Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source stack for blockchain developers to build sovereign layer 2 blockchains powered by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.

It consists of modular components designed to be fully composable; empowering developers to customize each aspect of their chain to meet their specific needs.

## CDK features

The CDK provides the components necessary to build a layer 2 blockchain that is secure, scalable, and interoperable with other chains. Below are some of the key features of the CDK:

- Security: Build high-performance, high-security, scalable L2s that utilize the latest innovations in zero-knowledge technology such as [plonky3](https://docs.polygon.technology/learn/plonky/?h=plonky3#plonky-3).

- Scalability: Transaction fees are orders of magnitude lower and processed substantially faster compared to Ethereum. Enabling a fast, cheap, and secure user experience unaffected by any extraneous high activity experienced on shared networks.

- Modularity: As logic is separated into modular components, developers can easily customize all components of the L2 to build a chain that meets their specific needs.

- Interoperability: Opt-in to the [AggLayer](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/glossary/#agglayer-v1-al1) to bootstrap your chain&rsquo;s ecosystem, enable cross-chain transactions, and access to the users and liquidity of other chains.

- Sovereignty: Maintain full control over your chain&rsquo;s revenue, governance, security, economic policies, and more.

## Dive deeper into the CDK

Whether you&rsquo;re a developer looking to build a new chain or a researcher interested in looking under the hood, the CDK documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the CDK&rsquo;s architecture, components, and how to get started building with the CDK:

- [Concepts](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/concepts/layer2s) to understand the CDK at a high level.
- [Getting Started](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/getting-started) to deploy a CDK stack on your local machine.
- [Architecture](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/architecture/cdk-zkevm/) to understand the CDK&rsquo;s components and how they interact with each other.
