The Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source stack to build sovereign layer 2 blockchains powered by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.

It consists of modular components designed to be fully composable; empowering developers to customize each aspect of their chain to meet their specific needs.

## Why Use the CDK?

The CDK bootstraps the development process of creating a layer 2 blockchain. Developers can easily set up the stack and begin configuring each component&rsquo;s behavior with a fast feedback loop on a local development environment.

As logic is separated into modular components, developers can easily swap out components in a "plug and play" fashion to customize their chain, for example, by replacing entire components such as the data availability layer, or making granular-level configurations to each component; such as modifying the sequencer logic to comply with legal regulations.

### Tap Into the AggLayer

By default, CDK chains are opted into the Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) which enables cross-chain transactions among other L2 chains that are also opted into the AggLayer, including the [Polygon zkEVM](https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/).

This provides a powerful network effect by enabling users to interact with smart contracts on your chain without having to manually bridge assets to it. This is especially useful for developers looking to bootstrap their chain&rsquo;s ecosystem and have immediate access to a large pool of users and liquidity.

### Utilize Best-in-Class ZK Technology

The Polygon team are pioneers in the zero-knowledge ecosystem and has built many of the most advanced ZK technologies in production today such as plonky2 and plonky3.

The CDK leverages these technologies to provide a high-performance, scalable, and secure layer 2 blockchain that is battle-tested in production with the Polygon zkEVM.
