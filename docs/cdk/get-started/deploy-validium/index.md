This quick start takes you through the process of deploying a full CDK validium, EVM-compatible network on Sepolia.

The process requires two separate flows with different software requirements. For this reason, these instructions have two distinct sections.

1. [Deploying the contracts](contracts/prerequisites.md).
2. [Deploying the node and services]().

!!! warning
    - The instructions are subject to frequent updates as the software remains at an early development stage.
