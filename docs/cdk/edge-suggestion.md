Suggestion: migrate the whole of the current WIKI docs into the repo.

[https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge)

In a `docs` directory which spins up how it looks currently in the wiki as a docusaurus site, or we can create a simpler static site if required. We can also review and edit like we're doing here but it might not be priority.

To discuss with Gabriel.
