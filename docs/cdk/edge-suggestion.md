So, we could put the whole thing https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/edge/ here. However, there may be a better option.

Suggestion: migrate the whole of the current WIKI docs into the repo:

https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge

Into a `docs` directory which spins up how it looks currently in the wiki as a docusaurus site, or we can create a simpler static site if required. We can also review and edit like we're doing here but it might not be priority.

We could do something simple that spins up a site in github pages and then leave it to them. I can do this next.
