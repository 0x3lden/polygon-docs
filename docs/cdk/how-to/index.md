This section describes how to manage policies pertaining to data access in the case of a Validium.

Validia store data off-chain, and with this option comes the need to manage both the data and access to the data. This is facilitated through policies that stipulate which addresses can have access to data. Lists of addresses, such as the Allowlist and Denylist, are therefore kept to exclude or include certain addresses to having access.
