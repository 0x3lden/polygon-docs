This document provides details of Polygon type-1 prover, which is a proving scheme deployed for the type-1 zkEVM developed in collaboration with the Toposware team.

As per the definition of zkEVM types, it's a type-1 zkEVM as it aims at proving and enabling verification of the EVM's computational integrity.

Since the design of a prover used in any zkEVM is closely related to the type of the zkEVM, this document starts with a brief discussion on the different types of zkEVMs.
