A comprehensive understanding of the following key areas is necessary for a full understanding of the documentation:

- Basics of the Ethereum L1 execution layer and how smart contracts work.
– Basics of token smart contracts (i.e. ERC20). 
- Basic cryptographic concepts:
    – Digital signatures.
    – Hashes and Merkle Trees.
- Programming Languages:
    – The zkEVM node is written in Golang.
    – The executor and the prover are written in C++.
    – The smart contracts are written in Solidity.
    – While not the primary language for production software, a basic understanding of JavaScript is recommendable to follow the documentation.
