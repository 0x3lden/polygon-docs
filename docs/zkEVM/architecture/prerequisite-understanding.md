Background knowledge of the following key areas is necessary to fully understand the zkEVM architectural, specification, and conceptual documentation:

## Ethereum L1 basics

- The execution layer.
- How smart contracts work.
- Basics of token smart contracts (i.e. ERC20). 

## Basic cryptographic concepts

- Digital signatures.
- Hashes and Merkle Trees.

## Programming languages

- The zkEVM node is written in Golang.
- The executor and the prover are written in C++.
- The smart contracts are written in Solidity.
- While not the primary language for production software, a basic understanding of JavaScript is useful for following the documentation.
