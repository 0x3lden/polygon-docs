zkNode is the software needed to run a zkEVM node. It is a client that network users require to synchronize and know the state of the Polygon zkEVM.

The main actors influencing the L2 State and its finality are the _trusted Sequencer_ and _trusted Aggregator_.

The zkNode architecture is modular in nature. See the below diagram for more clarity.

![zkNode Diagram](../../../img/zkEVM/fig3-zkNode-arch.png)

Most important to understand, is the primary path taken by transactions; from when users submit the transactions to the zkEVM network up until they are finalized and incorporated in the L1 State.

Polygon zkEVM achieves this by utilizing several actors. Here is a list of the most prominent zkEVM components;

- The **Users**, who connect to the zkEVM network by means of an **RPC** node (e.g., MetaMask), submit their transactions to a database called Pool DB.
- The **Pool DB** is the storage for transactions submitted by Users. These are kept in the pool waiting to be put in a batch by the Sequencer.
- The **Sequencer** is a node responsible for fetching transactions from Pool DB, checking if the transactions are valid, then putting valid ones into a batch. The sequencer submits all batches to the L1 and then sequences the batches. By doing so, the sequenced batches should be included in the L1 State.
- The **Synchronizer** is the component that updates the State DB by fetching data from Ethereum through Etherman.
- The **Etherman** is a low-level component that implements methods for all interactions with the L1 network and smart contracts.
- The **State DB** is a database for permanently storing state data (but not the Merkle trees).
- The **Aggregator** is another node whose role is to produce proofs attesting to the integrity of the Sequencer's proposed state change. These proofs are zero-knowledge proofs (or ZK-proofs) and the Aggregator employs a cryptographic component called the Prover for this purpose.
- The **Prover** is a complex cryptographic tool capable of producing ZK-proofs of hundreds of batches, and aggregating these into a single ZK-proof which is published as the validity proof.

Users can set up their own _local zkNode_ by following this guide [here](../../get-started/setup-nodes/local-node.md), or a production zkNode as detailed [here](../../get-started/setup-nodes/production-node.md).

## zkNode roles

The zkNode software is designed to support execution of multiple roles. Each role requires different services to work. Although most of the services can run in different instances, the JSON RPC can run in many instances (all the other services must have a single instance).

### RPC endpoints

Any user can participate in this role, as an RPC node.

Required services and components:

- JSON RPC: can run on a separated instance, and can have multiple instances.
- Synchronizer: single instance that can run on a separate instance.
- Executor & Merkletree: service that can run on a separate instance.
- State DB: Postgres SQL that can run on a separate instance.

There must be only one synchronizer, and it's recommended that it must have exclusive access to an executor instance, though not necessarily.

 The synchronizer role can run perfectly in a single instance, but the JSON RPC and executor services can benefit from running in multiple instances, if the performance decreases due to the number of received requests.

- [`zkEVM RPC Custom endpoints documentation`](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node/blob/develop/docs/zkEVM-custom-endpoints.md)

### Trusted sequencer

This role can only be performed by a single entity. This is enforced in the smart contract, as the related methods of the trusted sequencer can only be performed by the owner of a particular private key.

Required services and components:

- JSON RPC: can run on a separated instance, and can have multiple instances.
- Sequencer & synchronizer: single instance that needs to run them together.
- Executor & Merkletree: service that can run on a separate instance.
- Pool DB: Postgres SQL that can run on a separate instance.
- State DB: Postgres SQL that can run on a separate instance.

Note that the JSON RPC is required to receive transactions. It's recommended that the JSON RPC runs on separated instances, and potentially more than one (depending on the load of the network). It's also recommended that the JSON RPC and the sequencer don't share the same executor instance, to make sure that the sequencer has exclusive access to an executor

### Aggregator

This role can be performed by anyone.

Required services and components:

- Synchronizer: single instance that can run on a separate instance.
- Executor & Merkletree: service that can run on a separate instance.
- State DB: Postgres SQL that can be run on a separate instance.
- Aggregator: single instance that can run on a separate instance.
- Prover: single instance that can run on a separate instance.
- Executor: single instance that can run on a separate instance.

It's recommended that the prover is run on a separate instance, as it has important hardware requirements. On the other hand, all the other components can run on a single instance.

### (new version) ... zkEVM vs EVM differences

This document provides a comprehensive list of differences between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Polygon Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). The list includes supported EIPs, opcodes, and additional changes made to build the zkEVM.



### EVM-equivalence

Polygon zkEVM aiming being a Type-2, is designed to be EVM-equivalent rather than being compatible.

The difference between EVM-compatibility and EVM-equivalence is that;

- Solutions that are compatible, enable most of the existing applications to work, but sometimes with code changes. Additionally, compatibility may lead to the breaking of developer toolings.
- Polygon zkEVM strives for EVM-equivalence which means most applications, tools, and infrastructure built on Ethereum can immediately port over to Polygon zkEVM, with limited to no changes needed. Things are designed to work 100% on day one. 

EVM-equivalence is critical to Polygon zkEVM for several reasons, including the following:

1. Development teams don't have to make changes to their code, and thus nullifies any chance to introduce security vulnerabilities.
2. No code changes, means no need for additional audits. This saves time and money. 
3. Polygon zkEVM benefits from the security and decentralization of Ethereum, since transactions are still finalizing on Ethereum.
4. EVM-equivalence allows Polygon zkEVM to benefit from the already vibrant and active Ethereum community.
5. It also allows for significant and quick dApp adoption, because applications built on Ethereum are automatically compatible.

Ultimately, Polygon zkEVM gives developers an almost identical UX to Ethereum, but with significantly improved scalability.

    No impact on developer experience

â€‹    Note that the following differences have no impact on the developer experience with the zkEVM as compared to the EVM. Gas optimization techniques, interacting with libraries like Web3.js and Ethers.js, and deploying contracts work seamlessly on the zkEVM without any overhead.



Note that the following differences have no impact on the developer experience with the zkEVM as compared to the EVM. 

- Gas optimization techniques, 
- Interacting with libraries, like Web3.js and Ethers.js, 
- Deploying contracts work seamlessly on the zkEVM without any overhead.



### Opcodes

Below is a list of the changes we have made with Opcodes in zKEVM in comparison to the EVM.

- **SELFDESTRUCT** &rarr; removed and replaced by **SENDALL**.

- **EXTCODEHASH** &rarr; returns the hash of the contract bytecode from the zkEVM state tree without checking if the account is empty.

- **DIFFICULTY** &rarr;  returns "0" instead of a random number as in the EVM.

- **BLOCKHASH** &rarr; returns all previous block hashes instead of just the last 256 blocks.

> **BLOCKHASH** is the state root at the end of a processable transaction and is stored on the system smart contract.

- **NUMBER** &rarr; returns the number of processable transactions.
- **BASEFEE** &rarr; not supported. The zkEVM implements Berlin hardfork, but not the London hardfork.



### Precompiled contracts

Among Ethereum's precompiled contracts, the zkEVM currrently supports: **ecRecover** and **identity**.

Other precompiled contracts have no effect on the zkEVM state tree and are treated as a `revert`, returning all gas to the previous context and setting the `success` flag to "0".



## Additions

**zk-counters** &rarr; batch resources are available, linked to state-machine components, as a supplementary addition to gas computation.



## Other minor differences

- zkEVM doesn't clean storage when a contract is deployed at an address due to the zkEVM state tree specification.

- **JUMPDEST** opcode is allowed in push bytes to avoid runtime bytecode analysis.

- The zkEVM implements [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541) from the [London hardfork](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#london).

- [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) which defines **Typed Transaction Envelope**, is not supported
- [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930), which defines the **Optional Access Lists** transaction type, is not supported.
