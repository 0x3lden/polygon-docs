This documentation contains guides on how to connect wallets to the Polygon zkEVM network, deploy new or existing Ethereum smart contracts, and bridge assets between Polygon zkEVM and Ethereum.

Developers can find guides to setting up an RPC zkNode, spinning up a production zkNode, or even implementing their own fully-fledged zkEVM.

All the while, there is no need for any special toolings or wallets to build or interact with Polygon zkEVM.

Polygon zkEVM is fully compatible with Ethereum to provide a complete EVM-like UX for both Developers and Users.

Simply switch to the zkEVM RPC and start building on a network with a much higher throughput and lower fees.

:::caution Risks
