## Connecting to zkEVM

Add the **Polygon zkEVM** network to your wallet in order to interact with either the mainnet or the testnet.

Navigate to `Add network` in your wallet, and enter the respective network details as given in the below table:

| Network | RPC URL | ChainID | Block Explorer URL | Currency |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Polygon zkEVM | `https://zkevm-rpc.com` | `1101` | `https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/` | **ETH** |
| zkEVM Testnet | `https://rpc.public.zkevm-test.net` | `1442` | `https://testnet-zkevm.polygonscan.com` | **ETH** |


Once the wallet is connected, the next step is to bridge crypto assets from Ethereum to zkEVM. 

For testnet purposes, you can use the zkEVM faucet to get testnet tokens. 



## Deploying Smart Contracts

The development experience on zkEVM is seamless and identical to Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers on zkEVM can use their existing code and toolings to deploy on zkEVM with much higher throughput and lower fees.

Here is a video tutorial on **how to add Polygon zkEVM Testnet to MetaMask and deploy smart contracts**:
