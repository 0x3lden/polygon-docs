Our Vulnerability management lifecycle takes the output of  secure development lifecycle activities, together with results from vulnerability tools, such as security scanners  and ensures effective reduction of risk they present. 

Vulnerabilities are sent to a centralized issue and findings tracker ensuring that all identified vulnerabilities are effectively managed. This system enables appropriate validation, triage, assessment, and remediation/mitigation of vulnerabilities by assigning them to relevant teams and stakeholders. Polygon Labs establishes a clear workflow and procedures to prioritize and address issues based on their severity, potential impact, and exploitability.

Polygon Labs maintains open communication channels with vendors and security researchers, enabling us to stay informed of newly discovered vulnerabilities, patches, and updates. This collaboration significantly contributes to maintaining a secure environment by ensuring that systems and applications are up-to-date and protected against known threats.

All these activities, and others, are part of our robust vulnerability management lifecycle, which effectively reduces the risks associated with security vulnerabilities, strengthens the overall security posture, and maintains the trust and confidence of our clients, partners, and employees.
Authentication & Access Control

Polygon Labs establishes standards for authentication & access control in its information security policy and information security standards documents.

To ensure the security of our corporate systems, all employees must adhere to strict password guidelines. Passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters in length and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one numeral, and one special character. Passwords should be changed every 90 days and two-factor authentication is mandatory for accessing sensitive systems. Default, shared, or easily guessable passwords are strictly prohibited.

Polygon Labs performs entitlement reviews for sensitive systems on a yearly basis. Where applicable and available, systems are accessed via single sign-n (SSO).
